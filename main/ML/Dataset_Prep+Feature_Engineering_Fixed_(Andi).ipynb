We acknowledge that the use of this dataset has limitations, particularly because utilizing this dataset for building a Machine Learning model may result in the model being confined to the SBA dataset and may not be adaptable to KUR. However, the unavailability of KUR borrower profile datasets in public publications and the limited availability of KUR datasets themselves led us to decide that using the SBA dataset is an appropriate approach, considering the similarity between the KUR and SBA programs.<br><br>\n","\n","**Project Goal**<br>\n","The goal of this project is to create a classification system that determines whether a loan should be categorized as high risk, indicating a higher likelihood of default or non-payment, or as low risk, indicating a higher probability of full repayment. By establishing a specific threshold, the system aims to identify loans that pose a high risk and prevent their approval, while approving loans that are deemed low risk and have a greater chance of being fully repaid. <br><br>\n","\n","**Project Benefit**<br>\n","There are two benefits of this project. First, it allows micro, small, and medium enterprises (UMKM) to determine the potential approval of their loan applications. Second, it enables lending institutions to assess the risk of loan repayment for the credits they provide.<br><br>\n","\n","**Variables Explanation**\n","* **LoanNr_ChkDgt** : Identifier Primary key\n","* **Name** : Borrower name\n","* **City** : Borrower city\n","* **State** : Borrower state\n","* **Zip** : Borrower zip code\n","* **Bank** : Bank name\n","* **BankState** : Bank state\n","* **NAICS** : North American industry classification system code\n","* **ApprovalDate** : Date SBA commitment issued\n","* **ApprovalFY**: Fiscal year of commitment\n","* **Term** : Loan term in months\n","* **NoEmp** : Number of business employees\n","* **NewExist** : 1 = Existing business, 2 = New business\n","* **CreateJob** : Number of jobs created\n","* **RetainedJob** : Number of jobs retained\n","* **FranchiseCode** : Franchise code, (00000 or 00001) = No franchise\n","* **UrbanRural** : 1 = Urban, 2 = rural, 0 = undefined\n","* **RevLineCr** : Revolving line of credit: Y = Yes, N = No\n","* **LowDoc** : LowDoc Loan Program: Y = Yes, N = No\n","* **ChgOffDate** : The date when a loan is declared to be in default\n","* **DisbursementDate** : Disbursement date\n","* **DisbursementGross** : Amount disbursed\n","* **BalanceGross** : Gross amount outstanding\n","* **MIS_Status** : Loan status charged off = CHGOFF, Paid in full =PIF\n","* **ChgOffPrinGr** : Charged-off amount\n","* **GrAppv** : Gross amount of loan approved by bank\n","* **SBA_Appv** : SBA’s guaranteed amount of approved loan"],"metadata":{"id":"jfmjLGH5E5GH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Extraction\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"o_IRNWyP8vCU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Extract"],"metadata":{"id":"1t1JtN0hlCHP"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"AcLAqtA874ny"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from IPython.display import display\n","import gdown\n","import warnings\n","import requests\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = pd.read_csv('SBAnational.csv', error_bad_lines=False)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"WzlNWfutGQg_","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":595},"outputId":"c952a44f-0446-4027-b832-bf6195709585","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686386300032,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":3184,"user":{"displayName":"Andi Afifah Khairunnisa","userId":"01981112457183304697"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Skipping line 5199: expected 27 fields, saw 47\n","Skipping line 15559: expected 27 fields, saw 43\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   LoanNr_ChkDgt                           Name          City State      Zip  \\\n","0     1000014003                 ABC HOBBYCRAFT    EVANSVILLE    IN  47711.0   \n","1     1000024006    LANDMARK BAR & GRILLE (THE)     NEW PARIS    IN  46526.0   \n","2     1000034009          WHITLOCK DDS, TODD M.
