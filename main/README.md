Financing is a crucial factor for the success of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). A survey conducted by PwC shows that 74% of MSMEs in Indonesia do not have access to financing. However, on the other hand, the Government has implemented a program called People's Business Credit (Kredit Usaha Rakyat or KUR) to increase access to financing for MSMEs that have not been well served. As of mid-2022, IDR 185 trillion of KUR funds provided by the Government has not been successfully disbursed. Therefore, it is evident that there is a lack of information access regarding KUR among the public. PintarKUR is an application designed to educate the public about KUR, including its distribution mechanism and financing. This application is also equipped with credit risk analysis based on the customer's business profile in order to recommend whether the loan carries a high risk or low risk of default and thus helping the decision of whether they should take the loan or not. By doing so, the application aims to increase awareness and understanding of KUR among MSMEs, and ultimately, improve the utilization of KUR funds. Thus, the implementation of PintarKUR as a digital application to educate MSMEs about the KUR program is in line with the digital government transformation process that the Indonesian government is currently pursuing.
